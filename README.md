# Breath Better

A mindful breathing application designed to help you reduce stress, increase energy, and enhance overall well-being through guided breathing exercises.

## About

Breath Better is an open-source breathing exercise application that offers various breathing patterns including:

- Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)
- 4-7-8 Breathing
- Spiral Breathing
- Wim Hof Method
- Triangle Breath

The application features:
- Interactive breathing visualization
- Multiple breathing patterns
- Dark/Light mode support

## Open Source Philosophy

I'm a strong believer in open source software and the power of community collaboration. This project will always maintain a fully functional open source version that anyone can use, modify, and learn from.

While I am developing a premium version with additional features, the core functionality will remain free and open source. The premium version will help support ongoing development and improvements to both versions.
